        Yayoi Kusama (草間 彌生, Kusama Yayoi, born 22 March 1929) is a Japanese
        contemporary artist who works primarily in sculpture and installation,
        and is also active in painting, performance, video art, fashion, poetry,
        fiction, and other arts. Her work is based in conceptual art and shows
        some attributes of feminism, minimalism, surrealism, Art Brut, pop art,
        and abstract expressionism, and is infused with autobiographical,
        psychological, and sexual content. She has been acknowledged as one of
        the most important living artists to come out of Japan, the world's
        top-selling female artist, and the world's most successful living
        artist. Her work influenced that of her contemporaries, including Andy
        Warhol and Claes Oldenburg. <br />
        Kusama was raised in Matsumoto, and trained at the Kyoto City University
        of Arts in a traditional Japanese painting style called nihonga. She was
        inspired by American Abstract impressionism. She moved to New York City
        in 1958 and was a part of the New York avant-garde scene throughout the
        1960s, especially in the pop-art movement. Embracing the rise of the
        hippie counterculture of the late 1960s, she came to public attention
        when she organized a series of happenings in which naked participants
        were painted with brightly coloured polka dots. She experienced a period
        in the 70s during which her work was largely forgotten, but a revival of
        interest in the 1980s brought her art back into public view; Kusama has
        continued to create art, most recently and notably in installations in
        various museums around the world, from the 1950s through the 2020s.
